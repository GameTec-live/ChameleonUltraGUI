# Translations

If you want to collaborate by adding your language to the application, you can do it through [our Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/chameleonultragui). 

Do not contribute files into `chameleonultragui/lib/l100n/app_*.arb`. All translations should be added only to Crowdin. If your language is missing, you can create issue and ask to enable it. "Chameleon Ultra GUI", "Chameleon" and other trademarks should not be translated. 

Languages that are **70%** or more translated will be automatically deployed in the application.
