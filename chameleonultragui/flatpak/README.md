# Flatpak Packaging for Chameleon Ultra GUI

This directory contains the Flatpak packaging configuration for Chameleon Ultra GUI.

We use [flatpak-flutter](https://github.com/TheAppgineer/flatpak-flutter) to automatically generate the complete Flatpak manifest required for automated builds. This directory only includes the base manifest used as input for `flatpak-flutter`.

For the full, generated manifest used in production, please visit the Flathub manifest repository: [run.chameleon.chameleonultragui](https://github.com/flathub/run.chameleon.chameleonultragui)
