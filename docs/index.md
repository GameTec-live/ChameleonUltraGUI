## Translations

To traslate the app to your language, please follow the next steps (example with Spanish):
1. Go our Crowdin project: [Chamaleon Ultra GUI](https://crowdin.com/project/chameleon-ultra-gui), join it and start translating.
2. When you finish the translation, [fork the repository](https://github.com/GameTec-live/ChameleonUltraGUI).
3. On your forked repository, create a new branch with the name of your language in English (e.g. `translate-spanish`).
4. Download the file with the translations from Crowdin and put it in the `chameleonultragui/lib/l10n` folder. Maybe you need to modify the name of the file to match the name of your language in English (e.g. `app_es.arb`). Inside this file, `@@locale` must be the same as the name of the file (e.g. `es`).
5. Go `chameleonultragui/sharedprefsprovider.dart` and inside `getFlag` function add a case with your language (e.g. `case 'es': return 'Espa√±ol';`).
6. Remove the files inside `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_i10n` and run `flutter pub add intl:any`
7. PR your changes to the `main` branch of the original project.
